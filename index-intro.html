             In each of the nations there is an extremely powerful shinobi village. In the land of Fire, it is the Village Hidden In the Leaves,
               where most of the Naruto Series take place.</div>

        <div><p class='text-normal seventy margin-ten margintop50'>The terms "ninja" and "shinobi" are used interchangeably.
            A ninja will perform missions for a fee. The mission can invlude manual labor, acting as escorts, gathering secret information, 
            retrieving stolen items, carrying out assassinations, espionnage etc... Most of the shinobi come from a hidden village.
             Everybody cn become a shinobi. During times of war, a shinobi is expected to defend its village, even if it costs its life. <br> Note: the plural form of "ninja" and "shinobi" does not take a final -s.</p></div>

        <div><p class='text2 center-m seventy margintop-ten'>Ninjustu is one on the three main categories of jutsu (technique), along with Genjutsu and Taijustsu.
            Most ninjutsu require chakra and hand seals, 
           but this is not always the case since the mere usage of 
           weaponry qualifies as ninjutsu. This is the most used type of jutsu. Using chakra,
            you can create fire, clones, and even a ball of lightning.</p></div>

             You don't really need chakra for this, even though it can help sometimes. You need a lot of stamina and strength to get better at Taijustsu, as well as knowledge in martial arts, such as Kung Fu. 
             In short, all the punches and kicks fall in this category of jutsu.

            not real, being only sensory illusions experienced by those who fall victim to it. It creates an another dimmension. It isn't a physical jutsu.
             Nevertheless, it can traumatize and play with the mind of your opponent.  As a result, those placed under
              genjutsu for extended amounts of time can suffer from exhaustion and weariness from mental stress.

                The Chakra Pathway System is a term used to describe the point within the body that 
                channel chakra through it.
                 Simply put they serve the same function for chakra as blood vessels do for blood.
                 Chakra is essential to even the most basic jutsu. Through various methods, the most common of
                 which is hand seals, chakra can be controlled and manipulated to create an effect that would 
                 not be possible otherwise, such as walking on water, exhaling fire, or creating illusions.
