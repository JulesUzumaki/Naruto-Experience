            <div class='basic-info padding'>This is without a doubt one of Naruto's signature techniques. 
                The concept is to create clones of yourself. But rather than keeping them as illusions, like a normal Clone Justu, the clones are actually "real".
                 Nevertheless, it is a dangerous jutsu, Shadow Clone divides your chakra in equal amounts with your clones.
                So if you produce 3 clones then you chakra will be equally distributed in 3 clones. Naruto has immense levels of chakra so that isn't a problem for him.

            <div class='basic-info'>This is the Uchiha's signature jutsu. Sasuke can
                 be seen using it many times. The user basically turn some of his chakra into fire, 
                and expell it from the mouth in a massive orb of roaring flame. It can leave visible damage on the ground, like craters, or gravly burn the opponent's body.

                    the Nara Clan, Shikamaru's clan, an ability which allows them to control their 
                     shadows and use them to control the movements of others. Shikamaru uses it during the Chunin exams for example.

                    depressed, and twisted people and make them change their entire life's ideology in a matter of minutes. Though sometimes it can be very, very frustrating to watch.
