        <div class='squadseven'>This is the legendary Squad Seven</div>
        <div class='container-1'>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/narutobetter2.png">
                <div class='descrip-text'>This is Naruto. He is the main character. He is known as the No. 1 Hyperactive, Knucklehead Ninja.
                    <p class='hide'> He dreams of becoming Hokage, to win the respect of all the village. He is an orphan, and has the spirit of a demon trapped inside of him (there is a seal don't worry). No one respects him, 
                     and they all treat him like some kind of nobody. He was alone most of his life.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/sasuke10.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>This is Sasuke. Let's say he is Naruto's rival and best friend. He is from the Uchiha Clan, 
                    from which he is the only survivor. <p class='hide'> He doesn't talk much, and is focused on killing a certain person, 
                    thus achieving vengance. Many girls like him.</p></div>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/sakura.jpg" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Sakura, arguably the most useless character. She practically does nothing, 
                    apart from liking Sasuke and crying. </p>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/kakashi.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>And this is Kakashi, arguably one of the coolest characters. <p class='hide'> He has a very laid back attitude
                     and was considered a genius from a very young age.</p> He posseses the Sharingan, a special ability, and has a scar on his eye, 
                     which makes him even more badass.</div>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class='squadseven'>Some other cool ass characters</div>
        <div class=container-1>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/neji2.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>This guy is named Neji. He has the cool ability called the Byakugan. 
                    He can enable super-vision. <p class='hide'>
                     Neji is great guy, he is intelligent, and good in fights. He also has gorgeous long hair.</p> </div>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/lee.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>This is Rock Lee. He has a talent in Taijustsu (that is, hand to hand combat).
                     He wants to prove himself to Guy Sensei. <p class="hide"> He is extremely loyal and is in a way, a great comedic relief. </p></div>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/shikamaru5.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>This is Shikamaru. He has an IQ of over 200, but... he is kind of a lazy guy. Nevertheless, he is a great tactician and leader. <p class='hide'> He always complains 
                    about evertything, and does nothing to stop it. </p><p class='hide'> But he thinks greatly of others. (Plus we stan his earings) </p> </div>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/gaara2.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>This is Gaara. He is a bit peculiar: he has a sand demon trapped insde of him.
                    <p class='hide'> He always carries a gourd of sand around. It acts as a protective barrier, and as a weapon. It responds without even Gaara's instructions. He is so cool with his deep low voice, and eyelinered eyes 
                     (actually, it's because he does not sleep but..yeah). </p></div>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="./ressources/iruka.png" alt="">
                <div class='descrip-text'>Finishing with this guy, Iruka Sensei. He is one of the teachers at the Academy. <p class='hide'> He was the first one to aknowledge Naruto and becomes like a father-figure to him.
             He showed Naruto what it was like to have people that cared about you. He is the firt one who ever believed in Naruto. </p></div>
