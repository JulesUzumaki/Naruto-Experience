                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Naruto. He is the main character. He is known as the No. 1 Hyperactive, Knucklehead Ninja.
                     He dreams of becoming Hokage, to win the respect of all the village. He is an orphan, and has the spirit of a demon trapped inside of him (there is a seal don't worry). No one respects him, 
                     and they all treat him like some kind of nobody. He was alone most of his life.</p>

                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\sasuke10.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Sasuke. Let's say he is Naruto's rival and best friend. He is from the Uchiha Clan, 
                    from which he is the only survivor. He doesn't talk much, and is focused on killing a certain person, 
                    thus achieving vengance. Many girls like him.</p>

            <div class='character'>
                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\sakura.jpg" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Sakura, arguably the most useless character. She practically does nothing, 
                    apart from liking Sasuke and crying. </p>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\kakashi.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>And this, is Kakashi, arguably one of the coolest characters. He has a very laid back attitude
                     and was considered a genius from a very young age. He posseses the Sharingan, a special ability, and has a scar on his eye, 
                     which makes him even more badass.</p>

        <div id='squadseven'>Some other cool ass characters</div>

                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\neji2.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This guy is named Neji. He has the cool ability called the Byakugan. 
                    He can enable super-vision.
                     Neji is great guy, he is intelligent, and good in fights. He also has gorgeous long hair. </p>

            <div class='character'>
                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\lee.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Rock Lee. He has a talent in Taijustsu (that is, hand to hand combat).
                     He wants to prove himself to Guy Sensei. He is extremely loyal and is in a way, a great comedic relief.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\shikamaru5.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Shikamaru. He has an IQ of over 200, but... he is kind of a lazy guy. He always complains 
                    about evertything, and does nothing to stop it. Nevertheless, he is a great tactician and leader. He thinks greatly of others. (Plus we stan his earings) </p>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\gaara2.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>This is Gaara. He is a bit peculiar: he has a sand demon trapped insde of him.
                     He always carries a gourd of sand around. It acts as a protective barrier, and as a weapon. It responds without even Gaara's instructions. He is so cool with his deep low voice, and eyelinered eyes (actually, it's because he does not sleep but..yeah).</p>
            </div>
            <div class='character'>
                <img src="C:\Users\ACER\Documents\Projects-Coding\Naruto-Experience\ressources\iruka.png" alt="">
                <p class='descrip-text'>Finishing with this guy, Irika Sensei. He is one of the teachers at the Academy. He was the first one to aknowledge Naruto and become like a father-figure to him.
                     He showed Naruto what it was like to have people that cared about you. He is the firt one who ever believed in Naruto. </p>
