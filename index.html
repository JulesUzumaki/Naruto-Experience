            <div class='text-intro'> <div><p> Naruto <em>(Japanese: NARUTOナルト) </em> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
                 recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The show is split into two separate storylines: 
                the original Naruto following the young ninja-in-training as a child, and Naruto: Shippuden picking up with his later exploits as a teenager. While you might think 
                this would make it easier to digest, the two shows come to a whopping 720 episodes between them. </p>
            <div><p>Nevertheless, Naruto charactershave taughts us valuable life-lessons. Naruto taught us a lot but the most 
                important thing he taught us is to NEVER give up in life and what ever you want to achieve will not come 
                to you , you have to work your way though. It will be a very tough 
                road ahead but make that road fun , make a few friends and smile your way through it.</p></div>

                    from which he is the only survivor. He doesn't talk much, and is focused on killing a certain person, 
                    thus achieving vengance. Many girls like him</p>

                     and was considered a genius from a very young age. He posseses the Sharingan, a special ability, and has a scar on his eye, 
                     which makes him even more badass.</p>
