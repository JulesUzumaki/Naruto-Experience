            <div class='text-intro'> <div><p> Naruto <em>(Japanese: NARUTOナルト) </em> is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks
                 recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The show is split into two separate storylines: 
                the original Naruto following the young ninja-in-training as a child, and Naruto: Shippuden picking up with his later exploits as a teenager. While you might think 
                this would make it easier to digest, the two shows come to a whopping 720 episodes between them. </p>
            <div><p>Nevertheless, Naruto characters have taught us valuable life-lessons. Naruto taught us a lot but the most 
                important thing he taught us is to NEVER give up in life and whatever you want to achieve will not come 
                to you , you have to work your way though. It will be a very tough 
                road ahead but make that road fun, make a few friends and smile your way through it.</p></div>
